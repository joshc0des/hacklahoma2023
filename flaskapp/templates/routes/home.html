        Whether you are just beginning your tennis journey, or you are an experienced player, new strings are a part of the game. <br>
        Don't let the inconvenience of a string job keep you off the court! <br>
        We allow you to determine the most convenient dates and times for the job to be completed. <br>
        Here, your racket can be (1) picked up and dropped off by us, or (2) dropped off to the stringer by you, the user!

                    At Tennis Twine, our goal is to get your racket stringed 
                    up and back to you in the most convenient manner. As an OU student, this is 
                    an opportunity for me to support the surrounding communities while earning funds and gaining experience.

                    At Tennis Twine, we hope to improve the restringing experience by coming to you; 
                    we will do the traveling and stringing based on the pick up and drop off dates and times you provide. 
                    We offer lessons on that new set of strings at whichever courts are convenient for you!
