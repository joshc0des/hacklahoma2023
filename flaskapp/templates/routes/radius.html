        to visit an online radius mapping application. Use this to find your location <br>
        in relationship to the 20 mile radius. Type in the address below upon arriving to the website to create the area range: <br>
    <br>
        409 W Boyd St, <br>
        Norman, OK 73069
    <br><br>
        After entering this address, select the <strong>"Radius Miles"</strong> drop-down menu. From here select the <strong>"20 mi"</strong> <br>
        option. You now have a circle with a 20 mile radius displayed on the map!<br>
        <br>
        Now, simply type in the address of the requested pick-up / delivery location. This action will zoom into the newly entered address which <br>
        you can then expand your view to see if the location is within the circle that was created. If the location is within the circle, then <br>
        the service will be the flate rate $5 which includes both the pick-up and the delivery. If this is not the case, then there <br>
        will be an additional 75 cent charge for each additional mile traveled!
